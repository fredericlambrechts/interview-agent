Priority 4: Production deployment
```

## üìã Development Environment Setup

### Required Tools
```bash
# Core Tools
- n8n account (cloud or self-hosted)
- ElevenLabs Conversational AI access
- Supabase database access
- Next.js development environment

# Development Tools  
- Git access to repository
- Node.js 18+ for Next.js
- PostgreSQL client for database
- Postman/curl for API testing
```

### Environment Variables Needed
```bash
# n8n Configuration
N8N_WEBHOOK_URL="https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook"
N8N_API_KEY="your-n8n-api-key"

# ElevenLabs Configuration
ELEVENLABS_CONVERSATIONAL_AI_AGENT_ID="agent-id"
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="api-key"

# Supabase Configuration (existing)
SUPABASE_URL="your-supabase-url"
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-anon-key"
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="your-service-role-key"
```

## üéØ Code Reuse Strategy

### Files to Port to n8n Workflows
```typescript
// These contain business logic that can be recreated visually in n8n
‚úÖ /lib/interview/Step1Assessment.ts
‚úÖ /lib/interview/Step2Assessment.ts  
‚úÖ /lib/interview/QuestionGenerationEngine.ts
```

### Files to Keep As-Is
```typescript
// Database operations - called from n8n
‚úÖ /lib/database/* (all files)
‚úÖ /types/* (type definitions)

// UI components - simplified but not replaced
‚úÖ /components/* (remove conversation logic)
‚úÖ /app/* (update for n8n integration)
```

### Files Archived (Reference Only)
```typescript
// Replaced by n8n workflows
üóÑÔ∏è /archive/old-architecture/VoiceAgent.ts
üóÑÔ∏è /archive/old-architecture/InterviewOrchestrator.ts
üóÑÔ∏è /archive/old-architecture/DataValidationAgent.ts
```

## ‚ö° Development Principles

### 1. Visual First
- Build logic in n8n workflows, not code
- Use n8n's visual debugging
- Test workflows before coding integration

### 2. Simple Integration  
- One webhook from ElevenLabs to n8n
- One master workflow that routes everything
- Clear data flow: Voice ‚Üí n8n ‚Üí Database

### 3. Performance Focus
- Target <200ms for n8n workflow execution
- Target <500ms total response time
- Optimize database queries called from n8n

### 4. Error Resilience
- Handle ElevenLabs connection issues
- Implement n8n workflow retry logic
- Graceful degradation for external API failures

## üîç Quality Gates

### Story 3.1 Complete When:
- [ ] Voice ‚Üí n8n ‚Üí Voice flow working
- [ ] Database schemas created and tested
- [ ] Team can access n8n workflow editor
- [ ] Basic conversation tested end-to-end

### Story 3.2 Complete When:
- [ ] All core workflows visible in n8n
- [ ] Workflows execute <200ms
- [ ] Business logic fully visual
- [ ] Error handling implemented

### Story 3.3 Complete When:
- [ ] Full integration working
- [ ] Next.js UI simplified to display-only
- [ ] Real-time progress tracking working
- [ ] Performance targets met

### Story 3.4 Complete When:
- [ ] 5 complete assessments tested
- [ ] Production deployment successful
- [ ] Team trained on n8n
- [ ] Documentation complete

## üö´ What NOT to Do

### Don't Build These:
- ‚ùå Custom webhook endpoints in Next.js
- ‚ùå New agent classes in TypeScript  
- ‚ùå Complex orchestration code
- ‚ùå Custom conversation management

### Instead Build These:
- ‚úÖ n8n visual workflows
- ‚úÖ Simple database operations
- ‚úÖ UI components for progress display
- ‚úÖ Configuration and monitoring

## üìû Support & Escalation

### For Architecture Questions:
- Review `/docs/ARCHITECTURE-FINAL.md`
- Check `/docs/N8N-IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md`
- Reference `/docs/architecture/n8n-elevenlabs-integration-analysis.md`

### For Implementation Blockers:
- Review story acceptance criteria
- Check n8n documentation
- Escalate to project architect if needed

### For Production Issues:
- Follow disaster recovery procedures (Story 3.4)
- Use n8n visual debugging tools
- Monitor system performance dashboards

## ‚ú® Success Metrics

### Development Success:
- Stories completed on schedule
- No architecture confusion or delays  
- Visual workflows working as expected
- Performance targets consistently met

### Business Success:
- Natural voice conversations
- 23 artifacts captured accurately
- High interview completion rate
- User satisfaction with conversation quality

## üéâ Ready to Code!

**Repository Status:** ‚úÖ CLEAN  
**Architecture:** ‚úÖ FINAL  
**Stories:** ‚úÖ READY  
**Documentation:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE  

**Next Action:** Begin Story 3.1 - n8n Foundation Setup

The repository is now optimally structured for efficient development of the n8n + ElevenLabs architecture. All obsolete code has been archived, clear documentation is in place, and the path forward is unambiguous.

**Let's build something amazing! üöÄ**
