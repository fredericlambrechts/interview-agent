## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
From Story 2.1, we have established:
- ‚úÖ 3-agent collaboration architecture (Voice Agent, Interview Orchestrator, Data Validation Agent)
- ‚úÖ step_data JSONB structure working for Step 1 with 4 artifacts
- ‚úÖ Dynamic question generation engine and session management
- ‚úÖ Files: InterviewOrchestrator.ts, VoiceAgent.ts, DataValidationAgent.ts, Step1Assessment.ts, etc.
- ‚úÖ Interview can handle Step 1 (Core Identity & Business Model) completely

### Step 2: Customer & Market Intelligence - 4 Artifacts
[Source: PRD.md#step-2-customer--market-intelligence-4-artifacts]

5. **Market Sizing (TAM, SAM, SOM)** - Total addressable and serviceable market analysis
6. **Clinical Evidence & KOL Strategy** - Key opinion leader engagement and evidence requirements
7. **Ideal Customer Profile** - Target customer segmentation and characteristics  
8. **Customer Pains & Gains** - Pain points addressed and value delivered

### Extended step_data JSONB Structure
[Source: architecture.md#tier-2-assessment-interview-data]

Building on existing Step 1 structure, add:
```typescript
step_data: {
  "step_1_core_identity": { /* existing from Story 2.1 */ },
  "step_2_customer_market": {
    artifacts: {
      "artifact_5_market_sizing": {
        research_input: any;      // TAM/SAM/SOM data from research
        user_confirmations: any;  // Market size validations user confirmed
        user_corrections: any;    // Market sizing corrections from user
        user_additions: any;      // Additional market insights user provided
        completion_status: 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed';
      },
      "artifact_6_clinical_evidence": {
        research_input: any;      // Clinical requirements from research
        user_confirmations: any;  // Evidence strategy user confirmed
        user_corrections: any;    // Clinical approach corrections
        user_additions: any;      // Additional clinical insights
        completion_status: 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed';
      },
      "artifact_7_ideal_customer_profile": { /* same structure */ },
      "artifact_8_customer_pains_gains": { /* same structure */ }
    },
    step_completion_status: 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed';
    open_questions: string[];     // Step 2 questions needing validation
    step_confidence_score: number; // 0-100 based on Step 2 artifact completion
  }
}
```
