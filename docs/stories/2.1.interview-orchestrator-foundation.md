# Story 2.1: Interview Orchestrator Foundation

## Status
ARCHIVED - Replaced by n8n architecture (Epic 3)

## Story
**As a** user who has completed research and landed on the interview page,
**I want** to begin the structured 23-artifact assessment interview with intelligent orchestration,
**so that** I can provide comprehensive business context through natural voice conversation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Architecture Update Notice

**CRITICAL:** This story was implemented with a 3-agent architecture that needs to be refactored to use ElevenLabs Conversational AI webhooks. The current implementation works but should be migrated to the new architecture for better conversation management.

### Migration Required
- FROM: 3-agent system (Voice Agent, Interview Orchestrator, Data Validation Agent)
- TO: ElevenLabs Conversational AI with webhook endpoints
- See: `/docs/architecture/elevenlabs-webhook-integration.md` for new architecture

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Interview Orchestrator component manages the transition from landing page to structured assessment
2. First assessment step (Core Identity & Business Model) is fully implemented with 4 artifacts
3. Agent collaboration system is established (Voice Agent, Interview Orchestrator, Data Validation Agent)
4. Assessment session state management works with step_data JSONB structure
5. Dynamic question generation works based on research data gaps and completion markers
6. Step-scoped conversation memory maintains context within current step
7. Interview can transition between artifacts within Step 1 with proper state persistence

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
From Story 1.4, we have:
- ElevenLabs ConvAI widget integrated and working
- Interview landing page displaying research summary
- Basic voice interface established
- Assessment session auto-creation from research completion
- Need to transition from static landing to dynamic orchestrated interview

### 3-Agent Collaboration Architecture
[Source: architecture.md#agent-collaboration-architecture]

**Voice Agent (Presentation Layer)**
- Role: Pure ElevenLabs I/O interface only
- Responsibilities: Speech-to-text, text-to-speech, audio streaming
- Does NOT: Interpret content, make routing decisions, update data
- Implementation: Components in `/components/voice/` directory

**Interview Orchestrator Agent (Business Logic Layer)**
- Role: Core interview flow management and intelligent routing
- Responsibilities: Analyze user input, ask contextual questions, route information updates, maintain step-scoped memory
- Context Loading: Hybrid smart loading (immediate: current step + related, lazy: full context on-demand)
- Implementation: Core logic in `/lib/interview/` directory

**Data Validation Agent (Data Management Layer)**
- Role: Assessment data management (Tier 2 only)
- Responsibilities: Process confirmations/corrections/additions, update step_data, track completion markers
- Implementation: Database operations in `/lib/data-validation/` directory

### 3-Tier Data Architecture Integration
[Source: architecture.md#data-models-3-tier-architecture]

**Tier 1 Integration:** Interview Orchestrator reads research_data for contextual questions
**Tier 2 Integration:** Data Validation Agent manages step_data with completion tracking
**Tier 3 Integration:** Not used in this story (handled in Epic 3)

### Assessment Session step_data Structure
[Source: architecture.md#tier-2-assessment-interview-data]

```typescript
step_data: {
  "step_1_core_identity": {
    artifacts: {
      "artifact_1_company_mission_vision": {
        research_input: any;      // Original from Tier 1 research
        user_confirmations: any;  // What user confirmed as accurate
        user_corrections: any;    // What user corrected/changed  
        user_additions: any;      // New information user provided
        completion_status: 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed';
      },
      "artifact_2_core_offering_definition": { /* same structure */ },
      "artifact_3_regulatory_pathway": { /* same structure */ },
      "artifact_4_revenue_streams_pricing": { /* same structure */ }
    },
    step_completion_status: 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed';
    open_questions: string[];     // Questions still needing validation
    step_confidence_score: number; // 0-100 based on artifact completion
  }
}
```

### Step 1: Core Identity & Business Model - 4 Artifacts
[Source: PRD.md#step-1-core-identity--business-model-4-artifacts]

1. **Company Mission & Vision** - Core purpose and strategic direction
2. **Core Offering Definition** - Primary product/service value proposition  
3. **Regulatory Pathway (MedTech)** - FDA/CE approval strategy and timeline
4. **Revenue Streams & Pricing** - Business model and monetization strategy
