## Dev Notes

### Visual Workflow Architecture
[Source: architecture.md#architectural-patterns]

**Visual Workflow Orchestration:** n8n serves as the visual business logic layer
**Rationale:** Interview flows are inherently visual, drag-and-drop modifications without code deployment

**Key Benefits:**
- 60% faster development than traditional code
- Visual debugging and data flow inspection
- Business-friendly workflow modifications
- No deployment needed for logic changes

### Workflow Structure Overview
[Source: architecture.md#n8n-orchestration-hub]

**Key Workflows:**
- **Master Orchestrator:** Routes requests and manages conversation flow
- **Research Collection:** Tier 1 operations (external APIs, data enrichment)
- **Assessment Management:** Tier 2 operations (interview logic, state management)
- **Intelligence Synthesis:** Tier 3 operations (report generation, business intelligence)

### Master Orchestrator Workflow Design

**Flow Structure:**
```
ElevenLabs Webhook → Parse Request → Determine Action → Route to Sub-workflow → Format Response → Return
```

**Routing Logic:**
- **Research Phase:** Route to research collection workflows
- **Assessment Phase:** Route to appropriate step assessment workflow
- **Synthesis Phase:** Route to intelligence generation workflows
- **Error/Unknown:** Route to fallback response workflow

**Session Management:**
- Load session state from Supabase
- Maintain conversation context across workflow calls
- Update session state based on workflow results
- Handle session recovery and timeout scenarios

### Research Collection Workflows
[Source: architecture.md#tier-1-research-data]

**Company Research Workflow:**
1. **Input:** Company URL from user
2. **Process:** Web scraping, API calls, data enrichment
3. **Output:** Structured research data to Tier 1 (research_data table)

**Sub-workflows:**
- Website content extraction
- Social media analysis
- Financial data gathering
- News and press coverage
- Competitive intelligence
- Industry analysis and trends

**External API Integration:**
- Configure HTTP request nodes for various APIs
- Implement rate limiting and retry logic
- Add data transformation and normalization
- Store raw and processed data separately

### Assessment Management Workflows
[Source: PRD.md#official-assessment-structure]

**Step 1 Assessment Workflow (Core Identity & Business Model):**
- Artifact 1: Company Mission & Vision
- Artifact 2: Core Offering Definition
- Artifact 3: Regulatory Pathway (MedTech)
- Artifact 4: Revenue Streams & Pricing

**Step 2 Assessment Workflow (Customer & Market Intelligence):**
- Artifact 5: Market Sizing (TAM, SAM, SOM)
- Artifact 6: Clinical Evidence & KOL Strategy
- Artifact 7: Ideal Customer Profile
- Artifact 8: Customer Pains & Gains

**Workflow Components:**
- Question generation based on research gaps
- User response processing (confirmations, corrections, additions)
- step_data JSONB structure updates
- Completion status tracking
- Dynamic conversation flow management

### step_data JSONB Structure in Workflows
[Source: architecture.md#tier-2-assessment-interview-data]

**n8n JSONB Operations:**
```json
{
  "step_1_core_identity": {
    "artifacts": {
      "artifact_1_company_mission_vision": {
        "research_input": "{{$node.Research.json.mission_data}}",
        "user_confirmations": "{{$node.UserInput.json.confirmations}}",
        "user_corrections": "{{$node.UserInput.json.corrections}}",
        "user_additions": "{{$node.UserInput.json.additions}}",
        "completion_status": "{{$node.Validation.json.status}}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Synthesis Workflows
[Source: architecture.md#tier-3-company-business-intelligence]

**Data Synthesis Process:**
1. **Trigger:** Assessment session marked as completed
2. **Input:** Validated Tier 2 assessment data
3. **Process:** Combine research + confirmations + corrections + additions
4. **Output:** Final business intelligence for Tier 3

**Business Intelligence Generation:**
- Resolve conflicts (user corrections > research data)
- Generate confidence scores for each artifact
- Create comprehensive 23-artifact report
- Add team collaboration metadata
- Notify stakeholders of completion

### Performance Requirements
[Source: SCRUM-MASTER-ACTION-ITEMS.md - Week 2 Success]

**Target Metrics:**
- **Workflow execution:** <200ms per workflow
- **Total conversation response:** <500ms end-to-end
- **Database operations:** <100ms for JSONB updates
- **External API calls:** <300ms with timeout handling

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Parallel workflow execution where possible
- Database connection pooling
- Caching frequently accessed data
- Lazy loading of large datasets

### Error Handling and Resilience

**Retry Logic:**
- External API failures: 3 retries with exponential backoff
- Database connection issues: Automatic retry with circuit breaker
- ElevenLabs webhook timeouts: Graceful fallback responses

**Fallback Mechanisms:**
- API unavailable: Use cached/default responses
- Database issues: Store in temporary workflow memory
- Workflow errors: Return helpful error message to user

- Database schema remains unchanged
- API endpoints replaced by n8n HTTP nodes

**Next.js Integration:**
- Remove conversation orchestration code
