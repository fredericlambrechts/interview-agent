# **SuperSwift Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

## **Goals and Background Context**

### **Goals**

* Build a minimal viable prototype of SuperSwift's Assessment Interview Agent.  
* Demonstrate the ability to conduct structured business discovery through natural voice interaction.  
* Validate the conversational AI approach for business assessment.  
* Establish the technical foundation for voice-first interactions.  
* Create the data collection pipeline that feeds strategic asset generation.  
* Test user acceptance of AI-conducted business interviews.

### **Background Context**

The assessment interview is the foundation of all strategic consulting engagements. By automating this critical first step, SuperSwift aims to capture context that traditional forms miss, build trust through natural voice interaction, scale expertise, and accelerate time-to-value from days to minutes for medtech companies.

### **Change Log**

| Date | Version | Description | Author |  
| 2025-09-20 | 2.0 | Updated with 3-tier data architecture and agent collaboration system | Winston üèóÔ∏è |
| 2025-09-17 | 1.0 | Initial PRD draft. | John |

## **Requirements**

### **Functional**

1. **FR1:** The system must provide a voice-first interface for structured business discovery using ElevenLabs API through a 3-agent collaboration system (Voice Agent, Interview Orchestrator, Data Validation Agent).
2. **FR2:** The system must manage a conversational flow for the interview process with step-scoped memory, dynamic question generation based on research gaps, and guided progression with skip-ahead warnings.
3. **FR3:** The system must implement a 3-tier data architecture for business context collection:
   - **Tier 1:** Research data from n8n workflows (input layer, 90-day retention)
   - **Tier 2:** Assessment interview data with step-by-step validation (working layer, 60-day retention)  
   - **Tier 3:** Final business intelligence with team collaboration (persistent MCP target layer)
4. **FR4:** The system must be built as a full-stack web application with auto-creation of assessment sessions from research completion and template-based report generation.
5. **FR5:** The system must provide a processing UI during data synthesis and support team-based access control for business intelligence data.

### **Non Functional**

1. **NFR1:** The system must be scalable to handle concurrent voice interviews.  
2. **NFR2:** The system must ensure data security for all collected business context.  
3. **NFR3:** The system must be reliable to prevent interview interruption or data loss.

## **User Interface Design Goals**

### **Overall UX Vision**

The UX vision is to create a seamless, natural, and trustworthy conversational experience that feels more like an engaging discussion than a rigid Q\&A session.

### **Key Interaction Paradigms**

The primary interaction paradigm will be a voice-first, conversational interface. Secondary interactions will be visual indicators of conversational progress, context summaries, and a final call-to-action.

### **Core Screens and Views**

* **Company URL Form:** Initial form for company URL submission that triggers n8n research workflow.
* **Research Progress Page:** Visual indicator showing research workflow progress until completion.
* **Interview Landing Page:** Introduction page with assessment session auto-created from completed research.
* **Interview Interface:** Core voice interaction screen with step navigation, progress indicators, and completion markers.
* **Processing Screen:** Data synthesis progress UI with estimated completion time.
* **Assessment Report:** Final template-based go-to-market strategy assessment report.

### **Accessibility: None**

### **Branding: The design should be clean, modern, and professional, aligned with a B2B tech platform.**

### **Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive**

## **Technical Assumptions**

### **Repository Structure: Monorepo**

### **Service Architecture: Monolith**

### **Testing Requirements: Unit \+ Integration**

### **Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests**

* **Data Flow:** Form submission ‚Üí n8n research ‚Üí auto-create assessment ‚Üí interview ‚Üí data synthesis ‚Üí business intelligence.
* **Development:** Next.js starter kit foundation with Deno Edge Functions for server-side logic.
* **Local Setup:** Supabase CLI with 3-tier schema migration and Row Level Security policies.

## **Assessment Workflow Documentation**

### **Complete User Journey**

```
1. User submits company URL form
2. n8n research workflow processes company data ‚Üí Tier 1 (research_data)
3. Research completion webhook auto-creates assessment session ‚Üí Tier 2 (assessment_sessions)
4. User enters interview with smart context loading (current step + related data)
5. Interview Orchestrator asks dynamic questions based on research gaps and completion markers
6. Data Validation Agent updates step_data with user confirmations, corrections, additions
7. User navigates between steps (guided progression with skip-ahead warnings)
8. User completes final step ‚Üí triggers processing UI (30-60 second synthesis)
9. Data Synthesis Agent processes Tier 2 ‚Üí Tier 3 (company_business_intel) asynchronously
10. User receives template-based go-to-market strategy assessment report
```

### **Agent Collaboration Workflow**

**During Interview Steps:**
```
User Voice Input ‚Üí Voice Agent (transcription) ‚Üí Interview Orchestrator (analysis & routing) ‚Üí Data Validation Agent (step_data updates) ‚Üí Voice Agent (response synthesis)
```

**Post-Interview Processing:**
```
Completed Assessment ‚Üí Data Synthesis Agent ‚Üí Combine (research + confirmations + corrections + additions) ‚Üí Generate Business Intelligence ‚Üí Template Report
```

### **Data Tier Integration**

- **Tier 1 Integration:** Interview Orchestrator reads research data for contextual questions
- **Tier 2 Integration:** Data Validation Agent manages step_data with completion tracking
- **Tier 3 Integration:** Data Synthesis Agent creates final business intelligence with team access control

### **Step Completion Logic**

- **In-Progress Steps:** Interview agent actively asks questions, processes responses
- **Completed Steps:** Interview agent responsive to questions but not proactive
- **Dynamic Questions:** Based on completion_markers and open_questions tracking
- **Navigation:** Users can skip ahead with warnings, return to incomplete steps
