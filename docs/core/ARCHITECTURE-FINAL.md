## Component Responsibilities

### 1. ElevenLabs Conversational AI
**Does:** Voice conversations
**Doesn't:** Business logic, data storage, UI

**Configuration:**
```javascript
{
  "customTools": [{
    "type": "webhook",
    "name": "n8n_orchestrator",
    "url": "https://n8n.company.com/webhook/master"
  }]
}
```

### 2. n8n Visual Workflows
**Does:** All business logic as visual flows
**Doesn't:** Voice processing, UI, direct user interaction

**Workflows:**
- Master Orchestrator (routes all requests)
- Research Collection (web scraping, APIs)
- Assessment Management (interview logic)
- Intelligence Synthesis (insights generation)

### 3. Next.js Application
**Does:** Web UI for monitoring and reports
**Doesn't:** Conversation logic, voice processing, orchestration

**Pages:**
- `/` - Landing page
- `/interview` - Progress monitoring
- `/report` - View assessments
- `/admin` - Session management

### 4. Supabase Database
**Does:** Three-tier data storage
**Doesn't:** Logic, processing, presentation

**Tables:**
```sql
-- Tier 1: Input Layer (90-day retention)
research_data

-- Tier 2: Working Layer (Active sessions)
assessment_sessions

-- Tier 3: Output Layer (Permanent)
company_business_intel
```

## Data Flow Through Tiers

### Tier 1 → Tier 2 (Research to Assessment)
```
1. User starts interview
2. n8n fetches research from Tier 1
3. Creates assessment session in Tier 2
4. Returns context to ElevenLabs
```

### Tier 2 Operations (During Interview)
```
1. User answers questions
2. n8n updates Tier 2 working data
3. Tracks progress and state
4. Generates next questions
```

### Tier 2 → Tier 3 (Assessment to Intelligence)
```
1. Interview completes
2. n8n synthesizes all data
3. Generates business intelligence
4. Stores permanently in Tier 3
```

## Why This Architecture?

### 1. Simplicity
- Each component has ONE job
- Clear boundaries between components
- No overlapping responsibilities

### 2. Visual Control
- See business logic in n8n
- Modify without coding
- Debug by watching data flow

### 3. Best-in-Class Components
- ElevenLabs: Leading voice AI
- n8n: Proven workflow automation
- Next.js: Modern React framework
- Supabase: Robust PostgreSQL platform

### 4. Maintainability
- Change logic without deployment (n8n)
- Update UI without affecting logic
- Scale components independently
- Replace any component if needed

## Implementation Priorities

### Week 1: Proof of Concept
- Connect ElevenLabs to n8n
- Basic workflow in n8n
- Test voice flow end-to-end

### Week 2: Core Logic
- Build assessment workflows
- Implement question logic
- Connect to database

### Week 3: Polish
- Complete UI
- Error handling
- Performance optimization

### Week 4: Production
- Testing
- Documentation
- Deployment

## Key Design Decisions

### Decision 1: n8n Over Custom Code
**Why:** Visual logic is perfect for interview flows
**Trade-off:** Additional infrastructure vs. 60% less code

### Decision 2: Single Webhook Integration
**Why:** Simplifies configuration and debugging
**Trade-off:** All logic goes through one point

### Decision 3: Three-Tier Data Architecture
**Why:** Clean separation of research, working, and final data
**Trade-off:** More tables vs. cleaner data lifecycle

### Decision 4: UI-Only Next.js
**Why:** Clear separation of concerns
**Trade-off:** No server-side logic in web app

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Response time < 500ms
- 99.9% uptime
- Zero data loss

### Business Metrics
- 80%+ completion rate
- 23 artifacts captured
- High-quality assessments

### Developer Metrics
- 60% less code than traditional approach
- 2-3x faster feature development
- Visual debugging available

## Common Questions

### Q: Why not build traditional webhooks?
**A:** n8n provides visual debugging, built-in integrations, and 60% less code.

### Q: What if n8n goes down?
**A:** Self-host with redundancy, or use n8n cloud with SLA.

### Q: How do we version control workflows?
**A:** Export n8n workflows as JSON to Git.

### Q: Can we customize the logic?
**A:** Yes, n8n workflows are infinitely customizable visually.

### Q: What about testing?
**A:** n8n has built-in testing, plus we add integration tests.

## The Bottom Line

This architecture embraces **radical simplicity**:
- **One** integration point between voice and logic
- **Zero** custom orchestration code
- **Visual** business logic anyone can understand
- **Clear** component boundaries

Every architectural decision optimizes for:
1. **Simplicity** (can a new developer understand it in 10 minutes?)
2. **Robustness** (what happens when things fail?)
3. **Flexibility** (can we change logic without redeployment?)

This is the cornerstone architecture that will scale with the business while remaining maintainable and understandable.

## Next Steps

1. **Today:** Review this architecture with all stakeholders
2. **Tomorrow:** Begin Week 1 implementation
3. **This Week:** Achieve proof of concept
4. **This Month:** Full production system
