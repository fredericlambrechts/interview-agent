# n8n + ElevenLabs Implementation Roadmap

## Executive Summary

This roadmap defines the simplified architecture using n8n as the visual orchestration layer and ElevenLabs as the conversation layer. This approach reduces complexity by 60% compared to traditional backend development.

## Core Architecture Principle: KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

```
Voice → ElevenLabs → n8n → Database
         ↓
      Next.js (UI Only)
```

**That's it. No agents. No complex webhooks. Just visual workflows.**

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
**Goal:** Prove the architecture works end-to-end

### Day 1-2: Infrastructure Setup
```yaml
Tasks:
  1. Set up n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)
  2. Create ElevenLabs Conversational AI account
  3. Configure single webhook connection
  4. Test basic voice → n8n → response flow
  
Success Criteria:
  - Can speak to ElevenLabs
  - n8n receives webhook call
  - n8n returns response
  - ElevenLabs speaks response
```

### Day 3-4: Database Connection
```yaml
Tasks:
  1. Connect n8n to Supabase
  2. Create three database schemas:
     - research_data (Tier 1)
     - assessment_sessions (Tier 2)  
     - company_business_intel (Tier 3)
  3. Test CRUD operations from n8n
  
Success Criteria:
  - n8n can read/write all three tiers
  - Data persists correctly
  - Performance < 100ms for queries
```

### Day 5: Master Orchestrator Workflow
```yaml
Create in n8n:
  Name: master-orchestrator
  Trigger: Webhook from ElevenLabs
  Logic:
    - Parse action type
    - Route to sub-workflow
    - Return formatted response
    
Test Cases:
  - action: "start" → Creates session
  - action: "question" → Returns question
  - action: "complete" → Ends session
```

## Phase 2: Core Workflows (Week 2)
**Goal:** Implement the three main workflow categories

### Research Workflows (Day 1-2)
```yaml
Workflow: research-collector
Purpose: Gather company intelligence
Components:
  - Web scraping nodes
  - API integration nodes
  - Data cleaning nodes
  - Store to Tier 1
  
Output: Structured research data
```

### Assessment Workflows (Day 3-4)
```yaml
Workflow: assessment-manager
Purpose: Handle interview logic
Components:
  - Session management
  - Progress tracking
  - Question generation
  - Response validation
  
Key Feature: Visual question flow logic
```

### Synthesis Workflows (Day 5)
```yaml
Workflow: intelligence-synthesizer
Purpose: Generate final insights
Components:
  - Data aggregation
  - Insight generation
  - Report creation
  - Store to Tier 3
  
Output: Business intelligence report
```

## Phase 3: Integration (Week 3)
**Goal:** Complete system integration

### ElevenLabs Configuration
```javascript
// Single Custom Tool Configuration
{
  "name": "n8n_orchestrator",
  "description": "Connect to n8n workflow",
  "url": "https://your-n8n.com/webhook/master-orchestrator",
  "parameters": {
    "action": "string",
    "sessionId": "string", 
    "data": "object"
  }
}
```

### System Prompt for ElevenLabs
```
You are conducting a GTM assessment interview with 23 artifacts.
Use the n8n_orchestrator tool for all operations.
Maintain natural conversation while gathering structured data.
Guide users through all artifacts systematically.
```

### Next.js UI Updates
```yaml
Required Pages:
  - /interview - Display current progress
  - /report - View final assessment
  - /admin - Monitor sessions
  
No Conversation Logic: Just display components
```

## Phase 4: Testing & Optimization (Week 4)
**Goal:** Production readiness

### Performance Optimization
```yaml
Targets:
  - n8n workflow execution: < 200ms
  - Database queries: < 50ms
  - Total round-trip: < 500ms
  
Optimizations:
  - Cache frequently used data
  - Optimize workflow nodes
  - Database indexing
```

### Testing Matrix
```yaml
Unit Tests:
  - Each n8n workflow independently
  - Database operations
  - Data transformations
  
Integration Tests:
  - Full conversation flow
  - Error scenarios
  - Recovery mechanisms
  
User Acceptance:
  - Complete 5 full assessments
  - Gather feedback
  - Iterate on conversation flow
```

## Implementation Principles

### 1. Start Simple, Iterate
```yaml
Week 1: Basic working system
Week 2: Add complexity gradually
Week 3: Polish integration
Week 4: Optimize performance
```

### 2. Visual-First Development
```yaml
Design in n8n: Draw the flow visually
Test in n8n: Use built-in testing
Debug in n8n: See data at each step
Deploy from n8n: One-click deployment
```

### 3. Clear Boundaries
```yaml
ElevenLabs: ONLY voice and conversation
n8n: ONLY business logic
Next.js: ONLY user interface
Database: ONLY data storage
```

## n8n Workflow Structure

```

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Keep It Simple
- One webhook from ElevenLabs to n8n
- One master workflow that routes everything
- Clear, visual logic in n8n
- No custom backend code

### 2. Test Early and Often
- Test each workflow in isolation
- Test integration points
- Test error scenarios
- Test with real users

### 3. Document Visually
- Screenshot n8n workflows
- Create flow diagrams
- Record video walkthroughs
- Visual documentation > text

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
```yaml
Risk: n8n downtime
Mitigation: Self-host with redundancy

Risk: Latency issues
Mitigation: Optimize workflows, cache data

Risk: Complex debugging
Mitigation: n8n's visual debugging tools
```

### Process Risks
```yaml
Risk: Team unfamiliar with n8n
Mitigation: Training, documentation, pair programming

Risk: Workflow version control
Mitigation: Export workflows to Git

Risk: Testing complexity
Mitigation: n8n's built-in testing features
```

## Team Allocation

### Optimal Team Structure
```yaml
n8n Developer (1):
  - Build all workflows
  - Optimize performance
  - Handle integrations

Frontend Developer (1):
  - Update Next.js UI
  - Remove old conversation logic
  - Create progress displays

QA/Testing (1):
  - Test workflows
  - User acceptance testing
  - Performance testing
```

## Daily Standup Questions

### Week 1
- Is n8n connected to ElevenLabs?
- Can we complete a basic conversation?
- Are all three database tiers ready?

### Week 2
- How many workflows are complete?
- What's the average execution time?
- Any blocking integration issues?

### Week 3
- Is the full flow working end-to-end?
- How's the UI integration progressing?
- What errors are we seeing?

### Week 4
- What's our success rate on full assessments?
- Are we meeting performance targets?
- Ready for production?

## The One Command to Rule Them All

```javascript
// This is the ONLY integration point between ElevenLabs and your system
{
  "webhook": "https://n8n.yourcompany.com/webhook/master-orchestrator",
  "method": "POST",
  "payload": {
    "action": "start|question|respond|complete",
    "sessionId": "uuid",
    "data": {}
  }
}
```

## Migration from Current State

### What to Keep
- Database schema (three-tier architecture)
- Assessment logic (can be recreated in n8n)
- UI components (minor updates only)

### What to Remove
- All webhook endpoints in Next.js
- InterviewOrchestrator.ts
- VoiceAgent.ts
- DataValidationAgent.ts
- All backend conversation logic

### What's New
- n8n workflows (visual business logic)
- Single ElevenLabs webhook configuration
- Simplified Next.js (UI only)

## Final Architecture Statement

**"Every component does one thing brilliantly."**

- ElevenLabs: World-class voice conversations
- n8n: Visual, modifiable business logic
- Next.js: Clean, responsive user interface
- Supabase: Robust data storage

This architecture will scale, adapt, and maintain easily because each piece is focused, replaceable, and best-in-class at its single responsibility.

## Next Steps

1. **Today:** Set up n8n instance
2. **Tomorrow:** Connect ElevenLabs to n8n
3. **This Week:** Complete Phase 1
4. **This Month:** Full production deployment

The simplicity of this architecture is its strength. Embrace the visual approach, trust the tools, and build something remarkable.
